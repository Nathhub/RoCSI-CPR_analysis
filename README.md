# 🌊 AtlantECO RoCSI-CPR eDNA Metabarcoding Report

## Overview

This repository contains the full bioinformatics workflow and analysis for the **RoCSI-CPR eDNA project**, part of the EU-funded AtlantECO project (https://www.atlanteco.eu/).  
It documents the processing of environmental DNA samples collected along the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) transect, targeting the **18S rRNA V9 region** and the **COI** to characterize eukaryotic plankton diversity.

Analyses were performed in **R (v4.5)** using **DADA2**, **phyloseq**, and rendered via **Quarto**.
