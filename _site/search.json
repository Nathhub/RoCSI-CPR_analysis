Offshore samples cluster tightly, indicating more homogeneous conditions, while shelf samples are more dispersed, reflecting greater environmental variability. Overall, the pattern suggests that water-mass structure shapes protist community composition along the RoCSI–CPR transect.\nAlthough Open Ocean samples show slightly higher within-sample diversity (richness, Shannon), the ordination reveals that Shelf samples are more heterogeneous in composition. This indicates that while offshore communities are individually more diverse and compositionally similar, shelf communities are shaped by more variable environmental conditions, leading to greater between-sample variation.\nNOTE: the 5 samples clustered together in the lower part of the plot are the first 5 samples taken in first transect (close to Southampton). These samples occupy an extreme position in ordination space, suggesting strong compositional differences, which may be associated with dominance effects.\n\n\n\n\n                   SampleID     Axis.1     Axis.2\n04-CPR_1_ID_4 04-CPR_1_ID_4 0.05763766 -0.5796676\n03-CPR_1_ID_3 03-CPR_1_ID_3 0.02775392 -0.5598839\n02-CPR_1_ID_2 02-CPR_1_ID_2 0.13674985 -0.5337318\n01-CPR_1_ID_1 01-CPR_1_ID_1 0.07688155 -0.5139822\n05-CPR_1_ID_5 05-CPR_1_ID_5 0.19168445 -0.4301769\n\n\n\n\nPhylum composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — Protist Community Structure\n\n\n\nThe 18S protist communities along the RoCSI transect are dominated by Cercozoans (Heterotrophic protists/grazers) and Myzozoans (subphylum Dinoflagellata). Radiolarians (unicellular eukaryotes) are abundant in the open-water section of the transect, while Bacillariophyta (Diatoms) are abundant at the beginning of the cruise.\nIs this phyla composition ecologically coherent with expected shelf/open-ocean plankton dynamics during early spring in the English channel/Celtic Sea?\n\n\n\n\nPhylum composition - including NAs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 genera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — Dominant protist genera\n\n\n\nBreaking down the 18S community at the genus level reveals a mixture of picophytoplankton (Bathycoccus), mixotrophic and autotrophic dinoflagellates (Karlodinium, Karenia, Prorocentrum and Lepidodinium), and heterotrophic grazers (Goniomonas, Protoperidinium).\nThe high abundance of dinoflagellates Karlodinium, Karenia and Lepidodinium at the transition between shelp to open-ocean might be linked to the observed phytoplankton blooms seen from the satelite data and chlorophll index of the CPR (see below).\nLet’s note the high abundance of Goniomonas (Phagotrophic micrograzer) in the open-ocean!\nProbably: shelf –&gt; well mixed, Open-ocean –&gt; more stratified…\nNote: The “other” genius (including all the less abundant genera) is large, especially at low longitudes… IMPORTANT: “other” also includes NAs which can be not-assigned ASVs such as zooplankton. For example, ASV2 is the most abundant ASV in 01-CPR_1_ID_1 but has only Kingdom = Chromista as taxonomy. BLasting the sequence shows that it is the 18S sequence of Centropages sp. ASV3 = Oithona sp.\n\n\n\n\nMain Phytoplankton genera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly the CPR dataset has many occurences of Emiliania huxleyi but none in the 18S dataset… Let’s look for Gephyrocapsa sp. (other accepted genus)"

We start by visualising read depth per sample, followed by basic taxonomic composition summaries.\n\nRead depth per sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLet’s note that sample 60-CPR_3_ID_11 has 713,247 reads due to the fact that it had 764,251 raw reads from CGR. This difference is not due to the QC/DADA2 process but to the initial sequencing run.\n\n\n\n\nAlpha diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — Alpha Diversity Patterns (COI Marker)\n\n\n\nThe COI dataset shows clear and consistent differences in alpha diversity between water masses: Open Ocean stations harbor richer and more even metazoan communities, whereas Shelf stations contain fewer taxa and exhibit stronger dominance patterns. These results reinforce the 18S-based observations, indicating that both protist and metazoan communities display higher within-sample diversity offshore.\n\n\n\n\nOrdination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — COI Ordination (Beta Diversity)\n\n\n\nThe COI ordination reveals clear habitat structuring: Shelf communities are highly variable and distinct from the more uniform offshore assemblages. This pattern is consistent with the COI alpha diversity trends—Shelf waters show lower within-sample diversity but higher among-sample heterogeneity, while Open Ocean waters show the reverse.\nCompared to the 18S ordination, the COI separation between shelf and open-ocean samples is substantially stronger. This likely reflects the inherently greater spatial patchiness of metazoan communities on the Shelf, driven by environmental heterogeneity, including benthic–pelagic coupling, tidal mixing, coastal inputs, and the patchy distribution of zooplankton.\n\n\n\n\nPhylum composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — COI Phylum Composition\n\n\n\nThe COI phylum‐level composition shows that Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Cnidaria dominate overall. A distinct shelf–offshore gradient is visible. The low longitude samples contain more Chordata and Annelida.\nThe peak of Mollusca abundance in the open ocean might be due to pelagic gastropods (pteropods). There seems to be more Cnidarians (jellyfish) in the open ocean.\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 genera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — Interpreting the COI Community at the Genus Level\n\n\n\nAt the genus level, the COI data show a copepod-dominated zooplankton community along the whole transect:\n\nOithona (light green) and Paracalanus (orange) are abundant across almost all stations, forming a widespread “background” community present in both Shelf and Open Ocean waters.\nClausocalanus (red) is abundant in Open Ocean waters.\nOther copepods and zooplankton, such as Oncaea, Nannocalanus, Ditricohorycaeus, Mikroconchoecia, plus gelatinous taxa like Clytia and Pelagia, appear more patchily, with localised peaks at particular longitudes.\nThe rise of the “Other” category toward the eastern end suggests additional, rarer genera becoming important near the more coastal / English Channel–influenced stations."

Offshore samples cluster tightly, indicating more homogeneous conditions, while shelf samples are more dispersed, reflecting greater environmental variability. Overall, the pattern suggests that water-mass structure shapes protist community composition along the RoCSI–CPR transect.\nAlthough Open Ocean samples show slightly higher within-sample diversity (richness, Shannon), the ordination reveals that Shelf samples are more heterogeneous in composition. This indicates that while offshore communities are individually more diverse and compositionally similar, shelf communities are shaped by more variable environmental conditions, leading to greater between-sample variation.\nNOTE: the 5 samples clustered together in the lower part of the plot are the first 5 samples taken in first transect (close to Southampton).

Radiolarians (unicellular eukaryotes) are abundant in the open-water section of the transect, while Bacillariophyta (Diatoms) are abundant at the beginning of the cruise.\nIs this phyla composition ecologically coherent with expected shelf/open-ocean plankton dynamics during early spring in the English channel/Celtic Sea?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — Dominant protist genera\n\n\n\nBreaking down the 18S community at the genus level reveals a mixture of picophytoplankton (Bathycoccus), mixotrophic and autotrophic dinoflagellates (Karlodinium, Karenia, Prorocentrum and Lepidodinium), and heterotrophic grazers (Goniomonas, Protoperidinium).\nThe high abundance of dinoflagellates Karlodinium, Karenia and Lepidodinium at the transition between shelp to open-ocean might be linked to the observed phytoplankton blooms seen from the satelite data and chlorophll index of the CPR (see below).\nLet’s note the high abundance of Goniomonas (Phagotrophic micrograzer) in the open-ocean!\nProbably: shelf –&gt; well mixed, Open-ocean –&gt; more stratified…\nNote: The “other” genius (including all the less abundant genera) is large, especially at low longitudes… IMPORTANT: “other” also includes NAs which can be not-assigned ASVs such as zooplankton. For example, ASV2 is the most abundant ASV in 01-CPR_1_ID_1 but has only Kingdom = Chromista as taxonomy. BLasting the sequence shows that it is the 18S sequence of Centropages sp. ASV3 = Oithona sp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly the CPR dataset has many occurences of Emiliania huxleyi but none in the 18S dataset… Let’s look for Gephyrocapsa sp.

Radiolarians (unicellular eukaryotes) are abundant in the open-water section of the transect, while Bacillariophyta (Diatoms) are abundant at the beginning of the cruise.\nIs this phyla composition ecologically coherent with expected shelf/open-ocean plankton dynamics during early spring in the English channel/Celtic Sea?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💬 Discussion — Dominant protist genera\n\n\n\nBreaking down the 18S community at the genus level reveals a mixture of picophytoplankton (Bathycoccus), mixotrophic and autotrophic dinoflagellates (Karlodinium, Karenia, Prorocentrum and Lepidodinium), and heterotrophic grazers (Goniomonas, Protoperidinium).\nThe high abundance of dinoflagellates Karlodinium, Karenia and Lepidodinium at the transition between shelp to open-ocean might be linked to the observed phytoplankton blooms seen from the satelite data and chlorophll index of the CPR (see below).\nLet’s note the high abundance of Goniomonas (Phagotrophic micrograzer) in the open-ocean!\nProbably: shelf –&gt; well mixed, Open-ocean –&gt; more stratified…\nNote: The “other” genius (including all the less abundant genera) is large, especially at low longitudes… IMPORTANT: “other” also includes NAs which can be not-assigned ASVs such as zooplankton. For example, ASV2 is the most abundant ASV in 01-CPR_1_ID_1 but has only Kingdom = Chromista as taxonomy. BLasting the sequence shows that it is the 18S sequence of Centropages sp. ASV3 = Oithona sp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly the CPR dataset has many occurences of Emiliania huxleyi but none in the 18S dataset… Let’s look for Gephyrocapsa sp. (other accepted genus)"
