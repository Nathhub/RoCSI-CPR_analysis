# Discussion — Comparing CPR and eDNA: Dimensions of Diversity

The **Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR)** and the **RoCSI eDNA metabarcoding** represent fundamentally different ways of observing plankton communities. Rather than asking whether these approaches agree or disagree, a more informative question is at what ecological and taxonomic scales they converge—and where their comparability breaks down.

**A spectrum of biodiversity resolution**

These methods can be viewed as sampling different dimensions of diversity along a continuum of biological detail:

CPR (morphological counts) primarily captures
→ large-bodied, abundant, and morphologically distinctive taxa
→ reflects biomass-dominant and ecologically conspicuous organisms
→ integrates over time and space due to net sampling and tow length

eDNA metabarcoding (18S, COI) captures
→ small, fragile, rare, cryptic, or early life stages
→ reflects presence and relative diversity, not biomass
→ is sensitive to extracellular DNA, transport, and detection limits

Because these approaches target different components of the community, direct one-to-one taxonomic comparisons are not always meaningful.
